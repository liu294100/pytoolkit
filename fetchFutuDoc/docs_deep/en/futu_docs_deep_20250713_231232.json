    "title": "Greeks",
    "content": "The price of an option influenced by the price of underlying asset, the expected volatility of the underlying stock's price, option strike price, maturity and interest rate etc. Greeks are usually used to indicate the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the above-mentioned influencing factors. Those measures are important in managing risk of options. 「Greeks」 which are used in options pricing are shown in the following table:GreeksymboldescriptionDeltaΔthe rate of change between the option's price and the underlying asset's priceGammaγthe rate of change between an option portfolio's delta and the underlying asset's priceThetaθthe rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time.Vegaνthe rate of change between the option's price and the implied volatility.RhoPOption price sensitivity to risk-free interest rate changes.DeltaDelta，referred to as the \"hedge ratio\", represents the rate of change between the option's price and the underlying asset's price - in other words, price sensitivity. The ratio comparing the change in the price of the underlying asset to the corresponding change in the price of a derivative.Delta could be used in two ways：1. Delta HedgingAssume one holds 1 option and writes delta shares of ETF, according to the hedge ratio, a $0.001 increase in stock price will result in a loss of $Delta on the stock holdings, whereas the gain on the 1 option written will be 0.001*$Delta. The stock price movement leaves total wealth unaltered, which is what hedged position is intended to do.Calculating leverageFor example, if the price of ETF rises 1% and the option rises by 10%, then the leverage of the option is 10 times. Through Delta, we can calculate the leverage of the option. Assuming the ETF price is $3.000, a one-month call option with an exercise price of 3.20, the current price is $0.1000, and the Delta is 0.33. If the ETF rises 1%, which is $0.030, then the option price will rise 0.030*Delta, which is equal to $0.01. From the perspective of the change, the option contract has risen 10%. Therefore, the leverage of an option contract is approximately 10 timesGammaGamma represents the rate of change between an option portfolio's delta and the underlying asset's price - in other words, second-order time price sensitivity. For example, the delta changes 0.001*Gamma with respect to the price of the ETF changes $0.001.Suppose one holds 1 option and writes Delta shares of ETF, Delta changes as the price of the ETF changes. When the price of the ETF changes, the position of the ETF, Delta, should be adjusted in order to hedge the risk. A $0.001 changes in stock price will result in 0.001*Gamma changes on the ETF holdings. In a word, gamma indicated the difficulties of the hedge.ThetaTheta represents the rate of change between an option portfolio and time, or time sensitivity. If everything is held constant, then the option will lose value as time moves closer to the maturity of the option.VegaGenerally, the greater the uncertainty, the higher the risk, and the one who bears the risk requires higher compensation. As for options, expected volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of changes in a security's value. Similar to premiums, option sellers will also charge higher option fees for options corresponding to assets with relatively large expected volatility.Vega represents the rate of change between an option portfolio's value and the underlying asset's volatility. If everything is held constant, the price of the option will rise as the expected volatility of the underlying asset rise. Therefore, regardless of Call or Put option, Vega is greater than zero.RhoRho represents the rate of change between an option portfolio's value and the interest rate, or sensitivity to the interest rate. It expresses the change in the option price for every 1% change in interest rate. The higher underlying asset price, the longer the maturity, the larger the Rho. The Rho of the call option is positive, and the put is negative. Compared to other Greeks, Rho has the smallest influence on the option.*All the data and information above are for reference only and do not constitute any investment advice.

    "title": "Dividend and ex-dividend",
    "content": "1. The source of dividendsDividends are the profits that shareholders receive regularly from listed companies at a certain ratio, and dividends are the remaining profits distributed to shareholders in proportion to their shareholding after the listed company distributes dividends.Generally speaking, after the financial year is settled, a listed company will distribute part of its profits to shareholders as dividends based on the number of shares held by shareholders. Listed companies in China must publish their annual financial reports within 120 days of the end of the financial year, and the profit distribution plan must be announced in the annual report. Therefore, the dividend distribution is generally conducted in the second and third quarters.When distributing dividends, the preferred shareholders first exercise the income distribution according to the prescribed dividend rate, and then ordinary shareholders receive dividends based on the remaining profits. The dividend rate is not necessarily fixed. After the dividend is distributed, if the listed company still has profits to be distributed, it can pay dividends to commonshareholders.2. Distribution methodDistributing dividends in the form of bonus shares is keeping the cash that should be distributed to shareholders in the enterprise for development and reproduction. It is not much different from the temporary non-distribution of dividends by joint-stock companies. Stock dividends increase the number of shares held by shareholders, increase the company’s registered capital, and decrease the net asset value of the shares. But in fact, the total asset value of stocks held by shareholders has not changed.Property dividends are dividends and bonuses distributed to shareholders by listed companies with assets other than cash. Cash dividends are dividends paid by listed companies to shareholders in currency. It is also the most common and most common form of dividends. For example, the amount of dividends per share is a cash dividend. Stock dividends are dividends distributed by listed companies to shareholders in the form of stocks, which are commonly referred to as bonus shares.Since dividends and bonuses can only be distributed to shareholders after profits have been made, listed companies generally do so after the company's business year-end. In practice, some listed companies make two settlements in a year, one in the middle of the business year and the other at the end of the business year. Accordingly, two dividends are paid to shareholders to reward them in time to attract investors. However, an interim dividend is different from a year-end dividend in that it can only be paid within the margin of profit before the interim and only if no loss is expected at the end of the year.According to the Company Law, the basic procedure for dividend distribution by a listed company is that the Board of Directors of the Company first determines the dividend distribution plan following the profit level and dividend policy of the Company. And then it submits the plan to the shareholders' meeting for approval before it becomes effective. Finally, the board of directors can declare the dividend distribution plan to the shareholders and pay the dividends in an agreed manner at an agreed location on the prescribed dividend payment date.3. Ex-rights and ex-dividendsAlthough there are four forms of dividends and bonuses for listed companies, listed companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets generally only distribute profits in the form of stock dividends and cash dividends, which are collectively known as bonus shares and cash payments. When a listed company distributes dividends to its shareholders, the shares will be ex-dividend; when a listed company distributes bonus shares to its shareholders, the shares will be ex-rights.When a listed company declares its profits for the previous year available for distribution and intends to implement them, the stock is said to be a constituent stock, because holding the stock entitles you to a dividend. At this stage, the listed company usually declares a time called the \"record date\", which means that the shareholders holding the stock at the close of the market on that day are entitled to dividends.In the previous paper trading of shares, in order to prove the right to dividends to the listed company, shareholders had to register on the shareholding registration date declared by the company, and only those shareholders whose names were recorded on the company's share register on that date were eligible to receive dividends distributed by the listed company. With the implementation of scripless stock trading, share registration is conducted automatically through the computerized trading system; shareholders do not need to go to the listed company or the registered company to register their shares.4. The pros and cons of bonus sharesWhen it comes to dividends for listed companies, Chinese stock investors generally prefer bonus shares. In fact, for listed companies, there is no difference between giving bonus shares to shareholders and not giving any bonus at all or rolling over profits to the next year. All of these methods keep the profits that should be distributed to the shareholders in the enterprise as the capital for the next year's development and production. On the one hand, it enhances the operating strength of listed companies, further expanding the scale of production and operation of enterprises, on the other hand, it is not like the cash dividends that require a larger amount of cash to cope with the dividend work, because the enterprise generally keeps the cash is not much. Therefore, these forms are more favorable for listed companies.When a listed company does not pay dividends to its shareholders or rolls over profits to the next year, the profits are recorded in the balance sheet in the form of a capital reserve fund. When bonus shares are given to the shareholders, this part of the profit will be recorded as additional share capital and become part of the shareholders' equity. However, if the share capital of the listed company changes, the listed company has to re-register with the local business administration organization and publish the announcement of the change of share capital in addition to the bonus shares. However, no matter which of the above methods is used to deal with the profits of the previous year, the total net assets of the listed company will not undergo any change, nor will there be any form of change in the operating strength in the coming years.For the shareholders, the distribution of profits in the form of bonus shares will be better than no profit distribution. All these methods do not change the shareholders' shareholding ratio and do not increase or decrease the monetary value of the shares, because bonus shares split the shares into smaller shares and reduce the net asset value of each share in the same proportion, but they directly increase the economic efficiency of the shareholders. It is based on the following.4.1 According to the current regulations in Taiwan, the taxation of stock dividends can be deducted based on the savings rate for the same period, i.e., certain concessions are granted, and the specific tax amount is 20% stock income tax per share minus the savings rate for the same period.Income tax = (dividends per share - current year fixed savings rate) x 20%When a listed company does not distribute profits in the current year or rolls over profits to the next year, the amount of dividends will inevitably increase in the next year and the shareholders will have one less opportunity to enjoy tax relief.4.2 During the period when the supply of shares exceeds the demand, bonus shares increase the number of shares available to shareholders, which will help to increase the share price due to market speculation, and thus help to increase the shareholders' income from the spread.4.3 Bonus shares increase the number of shares and lower the price of the shares due to ex-rights, which lowers the threshold for buying the shares.Comparing a bonus to a cash payout, both are rewards to shareholders of a listed company, just in different ways. As long as the listed company makes a profit in a certain year, it is a reward to its shareholders.However, bonus shares and cash bonuses are different. If you compare them with bank deposits, a cash bonus is similar to capital deposit and interest withdrawal, i.e. depositors will withdraw interest once a year after depositing their money in the bank. The bank will convert the interest due to the depositor into the principal every certain period so that the interest can be renewed and paid in full at the end of the period. However, there is an uncertainty in this type of return, because converting profits into equity and putting it into renewable assets is a form of reinvestment, which also faces risks. If the company's operation is relatively stable in the coming years, the business development is relatively smooth, and the return on net assets is above average, then the shareholders can get the expected return; if the listed company's return on net assets is below average or the listed company has poor management after the bonus, the shareholders will not only not get the expected return in the coming years, but will also turn the previous year's bonus into fixed assets precipitation.In this way, bonus shares are not as good as cash dividends, as shareholders can choose to invest in other stocks or vehicles with higher profit margins after receiving the cash.",

    "content": "Warrant is the right to buy an underlying stock or asset, its value is determined by the price and the difference between the underlying share price .Suppose that the reader has a \"certificate\" to exercise the right, which allows you to buy a designated property for 1 million yuan, then how much is this certificate worth? If the current price of this house property is exactly 1 million yuan, the value of the right is zero, because this right will not bring any \"benefit\" to the holder. Assuming that the market price of the property has risen to 1.2 million yuan, at this point the holder can still buy 1 million yuan, and then sell at the market value, so you make 200 thousand yuan, that is to say, this warrant brought 200 thousand yuan of benefits. Right now, warrant holder has two options: exercise it by theirselves and then to cash out at market price, or sell this warrant to others. The latter situation formed warrants market. In the market, sellers will give this \"benefit\" to others, asking 200, 000 yuan, or he would choose the former way, to cash out.The situation in the stock market is the same. When the price of the underlying stock is 5 yuan and the exercise priceis 4.8 yuan, then the value of the warrant ( the price for exercising this right) is 0.2 yuan. If the underlying stock rises to 5.3 yuan, then the value of the warrant rises to 0.5 yuan. In this case, the rise of the underlying stock is 6%, and the rise of the warrant is 150%. The amplification effect reaches 25 times. In view of the author's experience , warrants amplifying effect is usually 4 - 12 times. But there are also tens or even hundreds of times magnification.In actual operation, few people hold warrants that expire. Often, when the underlying stock fluctuates sharply, they use the amplified leverage effect of the warrant to complete a fluctuate and leave. In times of extreme volatility, sometimes a fluctuate can bring 1-4 times profits to investors. This characteristic of warrent, attracted many investors to participate in.In Hong Kong, warrants are one of the most popular products. Since the first derivative warrant was listed for trading in Hong Kong in 1988, the types of warrants have become increasingly diverse. In addition to Blue chips, the underlying assets include indexes (Hang Seng Index and State-owned Enterprise Index) , major state-owned enterprise stocks and individual Chinese enterprise stocks, foreign indexes, currencies and oil, and the warrant product market shines brightly. According to statistics from the Global Federation of Stock Exchanges, Hong Kong's warrant market surpassed Germany, Switzerland, and Italy in 2005 to become the world's largest warrant market.At present, institutions, retail investors, and exchange participants themselves (including corporate and market makers) each account for one third of the total trading volume in the warrant market. This fully shows that warrant investment is a variety suitable for all ages. It can not only be used as an effective tool for institutions to carry out hedging operations and , but also as a good method for individuals to obtain higher returns to verify their own judgment.",

    "title": "Warrant",
    "content": "What is a WarrantWarrants are named by the homophony of English warrants, namely covered warrants. Holding a warrant is actually equivalent to holding a virtual right. From this right, warrants can be divided into two categories,call warrants and put warrants. The reason why this right is said to be virtual, the key is that neither the call warrant nor the put warrant is finally settled in kind but in cash, and most warrant investors only regard it as an tool to to earn a spread, not really want to buy the right.WarrantsGenerally speaking, due to the different underlying assets, there are two different types of warrants, one is company warrants or stock warrants, and the other is derivative warrants or covered warrants. Warrants are covered warrants. As we all know, stock warrants are generally issued by companies. They give holders the right to subscribe for the company's stock at the exercise price within a certain period or on a specified date, with the purpose of financing. After the holder pays the exercise price at that time, the issuer must deliver the corresponding assets. Covered warrants are actually an investment tool that is issued by investment banks. The purpose of issuance is not to raise funds but to provide investors with an effective tool for managing investment portfolios, and therefore does not require physical delivery. Just as stock warrants are linked to the issuer's stocks, covered warrants are also linked to certain assets, but this asset may be a stock, stock index, currency, commodity, or a basket of securities in the market. The investment bank that issued the covered warrant has nothing to do with it. As for the warrants in the Hong Kong market, they are linked to a stock or stock index, and the maturity is mostly about six months, and they are basically European warrants.Exchange listingWarrants are all listed and traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and trading is carried out based on the number of complete \"lots\", and delivery is carried out two days after the trading day (T+2). In addition to a fixed code, there will also be a series of symbols with special meanings for specific instructions. Taking \"China Life SG one seven bull EC\" as an example, \"China Life\" indicates that the underlying asset is China Life (2628.HK) stock; \"SG\" indicates that the warrant issuer is Societe Generale; \"one seven\" It indicates that the expiration date of the warrant is July 2021; \"Bull \" indicates a bull warrant; \"E\" indicates European warrant; \"C\" indicates a call warrant, and \"P\" is used for a put warrant. The meaning of the expression is \"the bull warrant issued by Societe Generale, the European call certificate with China Life stock as the target, which expires in July 2021 and is settled in cash\".Warrant main termsEach warrant will announce the relevant terms at the time of issuance. Taking the above-mentioned \"China Life SG one seven bull EC\" as an example, the warrant terms are shown in the table below.The right mentioned in the table is \"1.0\", which means that 50 CBBCs can be exchanged for one share of China Life (virtual) at the strike price. In fact, in the Hong Kong market, the conversion ratio of most warrants is 10, which means that only 10 warrants correspond to one stock. In addition, the \"number of shares per lot\" refers to the minimum trading unit of the warrant. This number is often directly related to the minimum trading unit of the underlying stock and the conversion ratio. The issue price of \"0.25 Hong Kong dollars\" indicates that each warrant is 0.25 Hong Kong dollars, which is the result of actuarial calculations by the issuer Societe Generale through a series of models.",

    "title": "Valuation of stock warrant",
    "content": "1. Stock warrant theoretical value = intrinsic value + time valueBefore we look at intrinsic value, we must understand an important concept \"equivalent ratio\". \"Equivalent ratio\" is the most basic index to measure the value of stock warrants, which reflects three value states of warrants: in-the-money out-of-the-money and at-the-money.Equivalent ratio= Underlying assets/ The strike price of the underlying assets represented by the stock warrantsFor warrants, if the equivalent ratio is greater than 1, the warrant is \"in-the-money\"; If the equivalent ratio is less than 1, the warrant is \"out-of-the-money\". The opposite is true for a put warrant. If it is equal to 1, both a put warrant and a call warrant are equivalent.Only when a stock warrant is in-the-money could it have \"intrinsic value\", intrinsic value is a value greater than or equal to 0, even if a warrant is \"out-of-the-money\", its intrinsic value can not be negative. Therefore, when the intrinsic value of the stock warrant is zero, its value will only remain the time value. Therefore, we can understand why the price of the warrant which is about to expire and is at-the-money or out-of-the-money will be very low.2. Factors affecting the price of warrants● Changes in underlying assetIf the price of the underlying asset shows an upward trend, the price of the call warrant will also rise, and vice versa; The price of the underlying asset tends to go up, the price of the put warrant will go down, and vice versa.● Remaining timeAs we mentioned above, the longer the remaining time of warrant, the bigger the time value, that is to say, the price of warrant is higher, it is the same for both call warrants and put warrants. But this is only in theory, we mainly introduce the European stock warrants, because they can be implemented only on the expiry date, the underlying asset price at that time can be high or low, this is also a risk factor, we must pay attention to this.● The amplitude of underlying assetVolatility is a standard way of measuring the risk of underlying assets. The greater the volatility, the greater the risk of the underlying assets, so the higher the warrant price will be.● The risk-free rate of interestThe risk-free rate of interest is generally refered to as HIBOR (Interbank Offered Rate) which is the opportunity cost borne by investors.The effect of the risk-free rate on warrants is two-sided.When the risk-free rate rises, the price of the underlying asset theoretically tends to fall, so that the price of the call warrant falls and the price of the put warrant rises.But from another point of view, due to the on stock warrant is a kind of leveraged investment, as interest rates rise, the opportunity cost of purchasing underlying assets will increase, causing some of the sound investors will put more money to charge interest, they will spend a small amount of money to buy call warrants, to strengthen the buyer's power of the call warrants , and the price of call warrants will rise; The price of a put warrant falls as the risk-free rate rises.When issuing warrants, the issuer may mobilize funds to purchase underlying assets. If the borrowing costs (i.e., the interest rate) increase, the cost will be reflected in the higher warrant price. Likewise, as interest rate rise, the price of a put warrant will fall.So in general, as the risk-free rate goes up, the price of call warrants goes up and the price of put warrants goes down.● Cash dividend income during the validity period of the warrantSince the holder of a warrant generally cannot receive a cash dividend as the holder of the underlying asset can, theoretically speaking, the higher the cash dividend is, the more disadvantageous it is to the price of the call warrant, while the opposite is true for the put warrant. However, since the price of the warrant issued by the issuer has already taken into account the possible dividends during the underlying asset period, if the dividend is in line with expectations, it should have little impact on the price of the warrant.From the perspective of the actual operation of the market, if the dividend is higher than expected, the price of the underlying asset may rise more than its excessive cash dividend because the investors of the underlying asset are more optimistic about its future prospects. Therefore, it will benefit the price of the call warrant, while that of the put warrant is opposite. If the cash dividend is smaller than expected, while theoretically beneficial to the call warrant, investors in the underlying asset may be bearish on its future prospects and the underlying asset may fall more than the part of the less, thus benefiting the put warrant while the call warrant is in the opposite direction. In summary, we believe the dividend impact is two-sided.",

    "content": "Warrant Basics-Summary field introduction1. The Formula for Outstanding quantity distribution is:Outstanding quantity distribution = Outstanding quantity / Circulation*100%It refers to the warrant held by other investors in the market as a percentage of total circulation. Circulation is the inventory quantity that can be sold at the time a product is issued by a issuer. When the product goes to market, other investors buy and hold it, so the outstanding quantity will increase. If the outstanding quantity distribution is high, the pricing power of the issuer will be affected, and then supply and demand factors will have the opportunity to take precedence over other factors, affecting the price of the warrant, and the price fluctuation of the warrant will be more drastic.2. PremiumCall Warrant premium = (strike price + call warrant price * entitlement ratio - underlying stock price)/ underlying stock price *100%Put Warrant premium = (strike price + putwarrant price * entitlement ratio - underlying stock price)/ underlying stockprice * 100 %The premium is how much the underlying stock would have to rise or fall to break even when an investor buys a certain warrant at its ruling price and holds it to expiry date. When choosing stock warrants, the smaller the premium, the greater the chance of winning, undoubtedly, there are other factors to consider.3. Entitlement ratioIt refers to the number of warrants held by the warrant holder in order to be entitled for one underlying stock. For example, the entitlement ratio of certain Call Warrant is 100, that is, for every 100 stock warrants held by the investor, the investor is entitled to exchange for one underlying stock.4. Strike priceIt refers to the price of the underlying stocks bought (call warrant) or sold (put warrant) by the warrant holder at the expiry date.5. GearingGearing = underlying stock price/ (the warrant price *entitlement ratio).The gearing shows the multiple proportions of warrant price and the underlying stock price. The higher the gearing, the higher the investor's profitability and, of course, the greater the risk of loss.6. Break Even pointBreak Even point of call warrant = strike price + call warrant price * entitlement ratioBreak Even point of put warrant = strike price - put warrant price * entitlement ratioBreak Even point means how much the underlying asset price needs to rise / fall if the investor buys and holds the warrant until the expiry date, so that the investor can break even.7. Expiry Date & Last trading dateAt the expiry date, warrants will face the expiration settlement and will no longer support trading. Trading would terminate 4 trading days before the expiry date, which is the \"last trading day\" in the App / Client.As a supplementary instruction, The settlement price at the time of settlement of the warrant, in the case of a stock warrant, shall be the average closing price of the relevant stock for the 5 trading days before the expiry date of the warrant (the closing price on the expiry date is not included); In the case of index warrants, the settlement price shall be subject to the EAS published by the SEHK. The EAS is the 5-minute average price of the Hang Seng index on the date of maturity.Stock warrants1. Effective gearingEffective gearing = [the latest price of underlyingassets / (the latest price of stock warrant * entitlement ratio)] * deltaEffective gearing means how many percentage points the warrant price would theoretically rise (subscribe) or fall (put) if the underlying asset price rose 1 per cent, other factors affecting the price of the warrant remaining constant.2. DeltaDelta is used to measure the sensitivity of the theoretical price of warrants to changes in the price of the underlying asset. Delta of the call warrant ranges from 0 to 1, they change in direct proportion, and that of put warrant is from -1 to 0, the change is inversely proportional. If the delta ratio is closer to 1 or -1, it indicates that the warrant price is more in-the-money; If the delta ratio is closer to 0, it indicates that the warrant price is more out-of-the-money; The closer the delta ratio is to 0.5 or -0.5, the closer the warrant is to equivalence.Another meaning of delta is to reflect the probability that the warrant will become in-the-money when it expires. The lower the value, the higher the risk and the higher the potential return.3. Implied volatilityRefers to that plug the market price of warrants into the warrant pricing model (such as Black-Scholes model), and the value of volatility obtained by backward extrapolation can be understood as the market's expectation of the volatility of the underlying stock in the future warrant duration. The implied volatility is positively correlated with the price of warrant. That is, in the case of other conditions unchanged, the greater the implied volatility, the higher the price of warrants (whether call or put).Callable Bull / Bear Contract1. Call priceCBBC features a mandatory call mechanism. When the underlying asset price of the CBBC touches the call price before the CBBC expires, the CBBC trading will be suspended, a Mandatory Call Event will take place to the CBBC, and CBBC will be settled.2. Gap percentage of callIt refers to the percentage of gap between the CBBC call price and ruling price of the underlying asset. Gap percentage of call=(the CBBC latest price of the underlying asset—Call price) / Call price*100%",

The higher the turnover rate of a stock, it means that the stock is more active and it is a popular stock. Individual stocks with a high turnover rate are often the target of short-term funds chasing. The stock price is flexible but the risk is relatively high.2. With the exception of some highly concentrated stocks, a lower turnover rate indicates less interest in the stock and the stock usually moves more stagnant.3. When the price of a stock has been rising for several days and there is a sharp increase in volume, but the stock price is not rising enough, or even when the positive side is falling, it indicates that the stock is shaking at a high level and the volume is enlarged, it indicates that there is an outflow of institutional funds.4. After a sharp rise in the share price, if the share price rises and the volume gradually decreases, the share price is just relying on people's confidence, indicating that funds are being withdrawn from the stock.5.

    "title": "The difference between warrants and options",
    "content": "What is the difference between Warrant and option? Many investors probably donot understand . From a broad perspective, the warrants canbe said to be a special form of options; however, in HongKong, there are many differences between warrants and exchange-listed options. Regardless of whether it is a stockoption listed on the Stock Exchange or a futures option listed on the Futures Exchange, the corresponding assets (such as underlying stocks or futures indexes) , validity period, and exercise price are all set by the exchange.On the contrary, subject to compliance with HKEx regulations，they may issue a single Call or Put warrent of different assets, period of validity and exercise price, a basket of Shares or even X warrent( special warrants) in response to market demand. In addition, the exchange also requires the option market to implement the \"banker\" system. The banker must, upon the request of the client, issue the purchase price and ask price of an option inquired by the latter.There is no \"official\" banker in the warrant market, but those banks that often issue the warrant are also actively involved in the purchase and sale of the warrant in order to maintain the reasonable price and circulation of the stock warrants under their ownership, which objectively plays the role of banker.In Hong Kong, the trading volume of options has always been lower than that of the warrants, so the spread of options is larger than that of warrants. Options investors often have to pay higher trading costs, which in turn further reduces the appetite of retail investors to buy and sell options. On the other hand, warrants are traded in the same way and with the same convenience. Higher trading volumes and lower bid-ask spreads make them more popular with investors.Of course, the warrants is not unlimited. For example, an option strategy can be Buy Call or Short sell, sell Put. But for investors, there is only one way to buy the Call warrents instead of selling the short Put warrents, which has certain limitations. In other words, options retail investors in need can be with the banker 'swap positions'; But warrant investors cannot 'turn themselves into' issuers.Be careful, the 'convenient' of options doesn't necessarily benefit retail investors who are not expertise, and don't have capital and hedging strategies ,because the benefit of short selling options is just get a finite number of the Premium , but there is a risk that the losses on the option may not be capped. Therefore, it can be seen that no matter what kind of investment vehicle has its advantages and disadvantages, investors shouldn't 'following the fashion' to speculate in all derivatives unfamiliar to them.Overall, the differences between warrants and options are as follows:1. Warrants Vs. Options1.1 Warrants demonstrate higher liquidity than options in the HK marketThe trading volume of the warrants tends to be higher than that of options.For example, on April 28, the market turnover was about HK$105.8 billion, of which about HK$16.2 billion was contributed by warrants & CBBCs, accounting for 15.3% of the toal.1.2 LeverageBoth warrants and options involve leverage, meaning that less principal will be used in trading options and warrants than in trading underlying stocks. On the one hand, using leverage can magnify returns. On the other hand, using leverage could pose higher risks.1.3 Some degree of risk controlThe maximum potential loss for warrants is your principal. In options trading, a seller of put options can receive the option premium at the begining, but there is no upper limit for the maximum potential loss.1.4 Exemption of stamp dutyTrading warrants is not subject to any stamp duty, but investors still need to pay tradings fees and brokerage commissions.2. Risks2.1 Limited warrant strategies availableYou can only buy warrants (buy call or put warrants).By contrast, in options trading, you can either buy or sell call/put options. Therefore, various option strategies can be formed, such as straddle and butterfly strategies.2.2 Warrants cannot be exercised at any timeThe warrants trading at HKEX are European warrants, which means that investors can only trade the warrants in the market or hold them until maturity. By contrast, apart from supporting warrant trading in the market and excercising warrents upon expiration, American warrants can be exercised at any time prior to expiration.3. Other differences3.1 Expiration dateFor warrants, the expiration date tends to be more diverse. As to options in the HK market, the expiration date is usually at the end of a month.Tencent warrantsTencent options3.2 CodeA warrant code is a five-digit number, just like a stock code. By comparison, options are not identified by codes. Instead, investors identify options by terms such as maturity date and strike price.",

It means that when drawing new shares, it is decided to bet heavily on the subscription of \"the upper limit of the number of new shares issued\". The formula for calculating the upper limit is half of the number of public offerings (not counting callback). For example, A companies issue a total of 100 million shares, 90 per cent of which go to international allotment and 10 per cent as public offerings, and investors can subscribe for up to half of the 10 million shares sold, 5 million shares. On the other hand, when subscribing for new shares, they will generally be divided into two groups: group An and group B. Group B is mainly an organization and high net worth customers, and the \"top mallet\" will be summarized as the largest number of shares subscribed in Group B.Generally speaking, the more the top mallet, the higher the subscription mood, the more bullish the market for the new stock.",

    "content": "1. Cost price (diluted cost) Formula: Cost price = (total amount bought during the holding period-total amount sold during the holding period) /number of holdings Meaning: Refers to the guaranteed price (excluding commissions and fees) of a stock during the holding period at which the user can break even by selling at that value. The profit and loss of each transaction during the holding period (excluding cash dividends, rights issues, etc.) are calculated, taking into account both purchases and changes in sales. 2. Amount of profit and loss Formula: Amount of profit and loss = (current price-cost price) × number of holdings Meaning: refers to the unclosed profit and loss during the holding period of a stock. 3. Profit and loss ratio Formula: P/L ratio = P/L amount / (cost price x number of holdings) = (current price - cost price) / cost price Meaning: the ratio of the profit/loss amount to the total cost. When the cost price is negative, the calculation is no longer applicable, so the P/L ratio is shown as 0.00%. This is also a common practice among peer brokerage firms that use diluted costs as their cost price. Note: The P/L ratio displays as 0 when the position is fully closed, as the calculation requires existing holdings. 4. Floating profit and loss today Formula: today's floating profit and loss = (today's market value - yesterday's market value) + (today's selling turnover - today's buying turnover) Meaning: refers to the user's profit and loss from the previous trading day to the settlement of the current trading day. 5. Open position ratio Formula: Open position ratio = market value of single position / net account value Meaning: The ratio of a user's position to the NAV of an account. Note: In the client terminal, users can understand account information from different perspectives by switching the denominator (single/overall account equity) of the position accounted for. 6. Holding period Meaning: The complete and continuous period of time from the opening of a stock position to its liquidation. If a stock is liquidated at some point and then bought or transferred into a new position, it is considered a new position and a new holding period begins. The cost of each holding period and the profit or loss is calculated independently. Position display settings You can use the following methods to set the position page field layout.

    "content": "We use Ping An Insurance as an example to calculate the difference between buying warrants and buying underlying stocks.On November 8, 2004, Ping An Insurance's stock price was 12.4 Hong Kong dollars, and the stock price was in an upward channel. Both investors, Mr. S and Mr. W, are bullish on the stock price of Ping An Insurance. The former bought the underlying shares and the latter bought a related warrant A at a price of HK$0.78. Ping An Insurance has 500 shares per board lot. About half a month later, Ping An Insurance's share price rose to 13.5 Hong Kong dollars, and Warrant A rose to 1.41 Hong Kong dollars. We use a table to calculate the return on of two investors.As can be seen from the above table, the investment cost of warrants is lower than that of the underlying stocks, but the rate of return is significantly higher. This is the performance of the warrants' \"Invest less and earn more\" and is the most attractive feature for investors.If calculated in terms of amount, the absolute amount of profit from investing in underlying stocks is relatively large, but the cost of investment is also several times the amount of funds invested in warrants. In the above case, investing in 500 underlying shares requires an amount of 6,200 Hong Kong dollars, while investing in 500 warrants only requires 390 Hong Kong dollars.Let's calculate the negative example again, that is, the situation where the investment is lost in the wrong direction.It can be seen from the above table that if investors misunderstand the market outlook, the loss of warrants will be higher. Therefore, warrants are a double-edged sword and must be used with care. But the biggest loss of warrants is all the invested funds. If the worst happens, Mr. W will only lose the entire cost of HK$650. On the other hand, the absolute amount of loss of HK$300 is also less than the HK$550 of investment losses.On December 28, 2004, the stock price of Ping An Insurance was 13.5 yuan. The two investors, Mr. S and Mr. W, were still bullish on the stock price of Ping An Insurance. The former bought the underlying shares and the latter bought a related warrant A. The price at that time was HK$1.3. However, the stock price trend was different from the judgment of investors. About half a month later, Ping An Insurance's stock price fell to 12.4 Hong Kong dollars, and the warrant B fell to 0.70 Hong Kong dollars. The two investors stopped their losses and went out.To sum up, investing in underlying stocks generally costs more capital and lower investment returns, but the risk is also lower; investing in warrants costs less funds and higher investment returns and the risk is also depends on the investment fund.",

Since these companies are more mature and do not need to spend a lot of money to expand their business, the main purpose of investing in them is to collect dividends. Also, don't invest in these stocks with a high P/E ratio, and pay attention to the history of stock price volatility during economic downturns. Popular stocks: Refers to stocks with large trading volume, strong liquidity, and high stock prices.

A very small ratio indicates that the stock price is low with low risks, and it is worth buying; too large indicates that the stock price is high with high risks, so you should be cautious when buying.

In away, it does not involve financing.According to the guidelines of the HKEx, listing by way of introduction has three forms:1. The company applying for listing has already been listed on one stock exchange and is seeking to list on another exchange. Or the company is looking to switch to a different listing board it has been listed on.2. Spin-offs refer to when listed corporations spin-off subsidiaries to be listed individually.3. The third way is to exchange shares for listing. That is, trading stocks issued by oversea issuers in exchange for stocks of one or more Hong Kong issuers, their listing status will be revoked at the same time.",

    "title": "What exactly are warrants",
    "content": "Warrants are commonly known in Hong Kong as \"warrants\" in English.Warrants are a \"right\" but not a liability. It gives the holder the right to purchase or sell \"relevant assets\" (e.g. shares, indices, commodities, currencies, etc.) at a predetermined \"exercise price\" at a predetermined \"maturity date\".There are two types of warrants in the market, commonly known as equity warrants and derivative warrants.Equity warrants: The company's fund-raising activities are carried out through the issuance of the company's share subscription certificate. At the time of exercise, the Company will issue new shares and sell them at the exercise price to the holders of the share equity warrants.Derivative warrants: Generally issued by banks. Issuers issue derivative warrants not to raise capital, but to provide investors with an effective tool to manage their portfolios. A derivative warrant is a listed security that is traded on an exchange and constitutes a contract between the issuer and the holder. The issuer's responsibilities and the terms and conditions of the warrant are detailed in the listing documents.In terms of the rights of the holder, warrants are divided into call warrants and put warrants.Call warrants: give the holder a right, but not a liability, to purchase the relevant assets for a specific period of time at an exercise price.Put warrants: give the holder a right, but not a liability, to sell the relevant assets for a specific period of time at an exercise price.In terms of exercise status, warrants are also divided into European Style Warrantand American Style Warrant.American Style Warrant: holders may exercise their rights at any time from the date of listing to maturity of the warrant.European Style Warrant: holders may exercise their rights only on the date of maturity. European style warrantsare the most common type of warrants in Hong Kong, We will introduce European style warrants here.However, whether the warrants are European Styleor American Style, investors can sell their warrants in the market before maturity. In fact, only a small number of warrant holders will choose to exercise the warrant, and most investors will issue the warrant before it expires.Here are three examples of buying a property.1. The basic concept of the exercise of powerSuppose the reader has a real-time right to purchase a designated property for HK$1 million. The value of rights is most directly determined by the price of the property. If the current price of the property is HK$1 million, then the right is basically worthless, because whether or not there is such a right will not bring \"preferential\". Assuming a property price of HK$1.2 million, the value of the right would be HK$200,000, since the holder of the right could purchase a property worth HK$1.2 million. If this right is sold on the market, the best cost would be HK$200,000.2. The effect of the length of the term on the exercise of valueAssuming the current property price is HK$1 million, the reader has two different rights, one is to exercise his right to purchase the property in real time for HK$1 million, and the other is to exercise his right to purchase the property a year later and the same to purchase the property for HK$1 million.The right to sell these two rights in the market and to exercise them in real time is still not worth it, because whether or not there is such a right will not bring \"preferential treatment\". However, a year later, the exercise of the right has a \"time value\", as there will be some expectations in the market, a year later the price of the property is higher than HK$1 million, others are willing to buy this right. When the market value of the property is above HK$1 million, they can sell this right at a higher price to others who expect the property price to continue to rise.The right to a one-year term would be worth more than the right to a six-month period. Similarly, the right to a six-month period would be worth more than the right to a three-month period. Because of the longer the duration, the greater the opportunity for delegates to exercise this right.3. The effect of asset price amplitudes on the value of the exercise of rightsSuppose that two properties have the same price of HK$1 million. One property is in the heartland and prices have been rising and falling, while the other is in a remote suburb where prices have never risen or fallen in the past 10 years.Assuming that the reader has two more rights, he may, after one year, purchase the central area property or the remote rural property for $1 million respectively. Which would be worth more if the two rights were sold on the market? Of course it's the right to be connected to a property in the heart of the city. Since the prices of properties in remote rural areas have not risen or fallen in the past 10 years, even if we wait another year, it is not expected that the property prices will deviate from the spot price of HK$1 million. Even if someone buys this right, they will not be willing to pay much value because the opportunity to exercise it is limited. On the contrary, although the price of property in the central area has risen or fallen, it will be worth it as long as there is an opportunity to exercise it.What do the above three examples illustrate on the warrant? Warrants give the holder the right to purchase or sell the relevant assets at a specific exercise price on a specified date. The price of warrants is most basically affected by the relevant asset price, the maturity time and the relevant asset price amplitude.Warrants \"magnify changes in positive share prices\". But in essence, a warrant is a \"right\" and its value ultimately depends on \"how many opportunities there are for that right to be exercised\". When it's clear, we can analyze how we can make a profit by buying and selling this right.",

    "title": "Judging the nature of individual stock adjustment from the form",
    "content": "During the whole process of rising, the stock price of individual stocks often seldom show continuous rise, and there will always be some adjustments and declines during the period. Such adjustments and fallbacks are sometimes short-term adjustments, sometimes long-term adjustments, and sometimes even changes in trends. Therefore, when stock prices fall, how to accurately determine the downward trend and adjustment time of individual stocks has very important technical reference significance for future operations. If you make a wrong judgment and regard short-term adjustments as long-term declines, you will often miss big bull stocks; on the contrary, if you regard long-term trend changes as short-term declines, you will suffer heavy losses. Therefore, the following is an analysis of some of the most common falling technical patterns as a reference for investors to judge the trend.One is that an individual stock has experienced a decline for one or two trading days after continuing to rise. You should not make a judgment. As long as the individual stock is still in the upward channel, you should continue to see more. This decline is only temporary during the rise. Adjustment; if the decline breaks the original track and trend, there may be a few months of adjustment, but in the medium and long term, it is still optimistic. If investors have the ability to operate on a band, they can make short positions, but most investors do not have this ability. Generally speaking, as long as the bull market is not over, they will hold them all the way; the third type of decline is a change in trend. This kind of decline continues to hit new lows, and the decline is often long-term. Once it is caught, it will be a long time. If this kind of decline occurs, investors need to leave the market early.From a technical point of view, it seems that the second and third cases are quite similar, and it is difficult to distinguish them. When they can be distinguished, the stock price has reached an extremely low level and has already suffered heavy losses. Here, we suggest that we can judge from the magnitude of the decline. Generally speaking, it is difficult to judge at the highest price or on the day when the highest price occurs in the operation, so there should be no requirement to exit at the highest price in the first place. For those stocks that are optimistic in the medium and long term, the decline from the highest price is relatively small, and there is often a rebound action, that is, the technical form of multiple heads; while the weaker stocks have a larger decline, but The rebound strength is relatively small. Such stocks tend to rebound less than half of the decline in the rebound. This situation often means a change in the long-term trend. Therefore, for those stocks that have fallen sharply in the decline, but have less strength in the rebound, it is necessary to end early.In fact, judging the stock price trend of individual stocks from the weekly line is very meaningful, because the daily line is very short and there will be quite a lot of fraud lines, which often makes it difficult for investors to accurately grasp the short-term trend. Generally speaking, those stocks that are adjusted in the mid-term will have a sideways box or ascending triangle technical pattern, but the trend-changing stocks will continue to bottom out.",

    "title": "Ex-rights and ex-dividend",
    "content": "1. Definitions2. Procedures3. Impact on the stock price 1. DefinitionsEx-rightsEx-rights refers to the adjustment made to a stock's price when a company changes its capital structure. This can happen through actions such as issuing new shares via a rights offering, distributing bonus shares, or conducting stock splits. On the ex-rights date, the stock price is adjusted to account for these changes, ensuring that it accurately reflects the company's value.Ex-dividendEx-dividend refers to when a company's stock begins trading without the value of its next declared dividend included in its price. On the ex-dividend date, the stock price is typically reduced by the dividend amount to reflect the upcoming distribution. Ex-rights and ex-dividend actions are measures taken by publicly listed companies to protect shareholder interests and stabilize stock prices. These actions ensure fair trading practices and help stock prices accurately reflect the company's true value.Note: \"Ex-entitlement\" is a broader term that encompasses both ex-rights and ex-dividend situations. It refers to the trading status of a stock after any entitlements, such as rights, dividends, or other benefits, have been distributed or accounted for in the stock price. 2. Procedures2.1 Official annoucementThe company releases an official notification to inform shareholders of upcoming ex-rights or ex-dividend actions, detailing the specifics of the corporate action.2.2 Determining key datesRecord Date: This is the cut-off date to determine which shareholders are eligible to participate in the corporate action.Ex-Date: The first day the stock trades without the entitlement, meaning the stock price adjusts to reflect the change.2.3 Confirming shareholder eligibilityOn the record date, the company updates its records to ensure eligible shareholders are accurately listed for the corporate action.2.4 Executing the corporate actionEx-Rights: The company implements actions like issuing bonus shares, rights issues, or stock splits according to the announced ratio for eligible shareholders.Ex-Dividend: The company distributes cash dividends to those who are eligible.2.5 Adjusting the stock priceOn the ex-date, the stock's trading price will be adjusted accordingly:Ex-Rights: The stock price and the number of shares held by shareholders will be adjusted according to the new stock ratio.Ex-Dividend: The stock price usually drops by about the same amount as the dividend per share. 3. Impact on the stock priceThe impact of ex-rights and ex-dividend events on stock prices is illustrated through the following examples.Changes in stock price during ex-rights:Example ADateEntitlementStock PriceShare Qty HeldShareholding ValueDescriptionBefore the ex-rights date/10.00 HKD1001,000.00 HKDBefore the ex-rights date, the shareholder holds 100 shares, with each share priced at 10.00 HKD, resulting in a total shareholding value of 1,000.00 HKD.On the ex-rights date2-for-1 stock split10÷2=5.00 HKD2001,000.00 HKDOn the ex-rights date, the company implements a stock split, where each share is split into 2 shares. This increases the shareholder's total number of shares to 200. Consequently, the stock price is adjusted to approximately 5.00 HKD, while the overall shareholding value remains unchanged at 1,000,00 HKD. Example BDateEntitlementStock PriceShare Qty HeldShareholding ValueDescriptionBefore the ex-rights date/10.00 HKD1001,000.00 HKDBefore the ex-rights date, the shareholder holds 100 shares, with each share priced at 10.00 HKD, resulting in a total shareholding value of 1,000.00 HKD.On the ex-rights date1-for-2 reverse stock split10.00*2=20.00 HKD2001,000.00 HKDOn the ex-rights date, the company implements a 1-for-2 reverse stock split, where every 2 shares are consolidated into 1 share. This reduces the shareholder's total number of shares to 50. Consequently, the stock price is adjusted to approximately 20.00 HKD per share, while the overall shareholding value remains unchanged at 1,000.00 HKD. Changes in stock price during ex-dividend:ExampleDateEntitlementStock PriceShare Qty HeldShareholding ValueDescriptionBefore the ex-dividend date/10.00 HKD1001,000.00 HKDBefore the ex-dividend date, the shareholder holds 100 shares, with each share priced at 10.00 HKD, resulting in a total shareholding value of 1,000.00 HKD.On the ex-dividend dateCash dividend of 1 HKD per share9.00 HKD100900.00 HKD shareholding value + 100.00 HKD cash dividendOn the ex-dividend date, the stock price drops from 10.00 HKD to 9.00 HKD, reflecting the dividend payout. The share quantity held remains unchanged at 100. The total shareholding value, which includes both the adjusted stock value and the received cash dividends, remains unchanged at 1,000.00 HKD.",

    "title": "Basic concepts of a stock",
    "content": "Basic field 1. Market value Formula: Market value = total equity × latest price Meaning: refers to the total stock value of a listed company's total shares calculated at market prices 2. Current value Formula: Current value = tradable shares × latest price Meaning: refers to the stock value of a listed company's shares circulating in the market calculated at market prices 3. Total equity Meaning: the total equity is the total number of shares issued by the stock company. 4. Tradable equity Meaning: tradable equity refers to the shares of a listed company that only circulate in the market. Note: For ADS-listed stocks, the outstanding shares are calculated and no official information is available. 5. Turnover rate Formula: Turnover rate = (number of shares traded / number of shares outstanding at the time) × 100% Meaning: Refers to the frequency of stocks changing hands in the market within a certain period of time, and is one of the indicators that reflect the strength of stock liquidity. 6. Amplitude Formula: Amplitude = (the price of the highest point of the day - the price of the lowest point of the day) / the closing priceyesterday× 100% Meaning: the absolute value of the difference between the highest and lowest price of the day after the opening of the stock and the percentage of the previous day's closing price, which shows the activity of the stock. 7. Committee Formula: Committee= (commission to buy the number of lots - commission to sell the number of lots) / (commission to buy the number of lots + commission to sell the number of lots) × 100%. Meaning: The ratio of all orders on the quotation system, used to measure the relative strength of orders over a period of time. 8. Volume ratio Formula: Volume Ratio = (Current total lots traded / Current cumulative opening time (minutes)) / Average volume per minute over the past 5 days. Meaning: The ratio of the average volume per minute since the market opened to the average volume per minute over the past 5 trading days. Volume ratio is a measure of relative volume. Financial field 1.

The earnings per share in the rolling price-earnings ratio uses the financial data of the past four quarters. Although its starting point will change, and these four quarters may belong to two different natural years, it still makes up for the objective seasonality of listed companies. The impact of the difference makes up for the timeliness of the static P/E ratio using year-on-year data. 3. P/Bratio Formula: P/Bratio = latest price/net assets per share attributable to ordinary shareholders Meaning: Refers to the net assets attributable to ordinary shareholders per share based on the market price ratio. The generalized net assets are not selected for calculation to reflect the corresponding equity of ordinary shares. Among them, the net assets per share is the ratio of common shareholders’ equity in the latest reported balance sheet to the total share capital. 4. Dividend yield Meaning: the ratio of dividends to stock price. It is one of the important indicators which are used to determine whether a company is a worthwhile .

It should be noted that the futures index is a special product whose price is determined now and will be settled at the end of each month when the contract expires. On the settlement day, the futures price should be equal to the spot price, i.e. the futures index should be equal to the HSI.Therefore, the spot price of the futures index is an estimate of the closing price of the HSI on the future expiry date. If the futures price is low, it means that investors expect the HSI will fall in the future and the market will become weak.2. High waterHigh water, also known as rising water, usually refers to the fact that the price of futures is higher than the spot price.For example, if the futures index (i.e. HSI futures) is higher than the HSI (i.e. Hang Seng Index), it is called high water in the futures index.A high price of a futures index is generally regarded as an indicator of a positive market trend because investors in the futures market are willing to buy the index at a higher price than the spot market, which indicates investors' confidence in the market.",

One-Lot Allotment RateOne-Lot Allotment Rate is the probability of being allotted when subscribing to one lot of stock .2. \"Do a Header\"According to regulations, one can subscribe to up to a half of the total shares of an IPO (without claw-back). Subscribing the maximum quantity is referred to as \"do a header\".3. Group A/BA subscription with an amount less than or equal to 5 million is classified into Group A, while that with more than 5 million is classified into Group B.4. Cornerstone InvestorsCornerstone investors refer to institutional investors who subscribe to company stocks as strategic investors before stock IPO and accept a lock-up period for 6 to 12 months. They are mainly banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and other large institutional investors as well as large enterprise groups, well-known magnates, and their affiliated companies.5. SponsorsA sponsor must be a company or authorized financial institution licensed by and registered with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). The sponsor is responsible for assisting companies with IPO applications. It should provide professional advice on IPO to the company concerned and assist it in handling various matters related to an IPO. At the same time, it is responsible for the communication between the company to be listed, the Exchange, the SFC and various professional intermediaries. At the operational level, the sponsor should submit the official listing application form and all related documents to the Stock Exchange. The sponsor should ensure that all relevant important information has been fully and accurately disclosed in the prospectus, and that all directors of the company to be listed understand their responsibilities as directors of a listed company.6. UnderwritersAn underwriter refers to a securities institution that exclusively underwrites or leads an underwriting syndicate in the issuance of stocks. Abroad, stock underwriters are generally served by reputable and powerful merchant banks (UK), banks (US), and large securities companies.7. The GreenshoeThe Greenshoe Mechanism is the nickname for the over-allotment option system, also known as the Green Shoe Option.It refers to an option granted by the issuer to the lead underwriter within 30 days after the stock is listed. The lead underwriter can choose to issue up to 15% more shares than the predetermined number at issuance price.If the trading price of the stock is lower than the issuance price after listing, the lead underwriter can use the funds obtained from the prior selling of shares (investors’ funds for subscribing over-allotted shares) to purchase from the secondary market at a price no higher than the issuance price and then distribute the shares to investors who subscribed the over-allotted shares. If the trading price of the stock is higher than the issuance price after listing, the lead underwriter will ask the issuer to issue 15% more shares, which will then be allocated to investors who have subscribed in advance. The funds from the additional issuance of new shares belong to the issuer, and the additional shares issued will be included in the number of total shares issued.",

The other 10% is a public offering for all investors to subscribe for.If the public offering is very hot (oversubscribed multiple), it will be refunded to the public for sale in the international market, for example, more than 100 times, 50% will be redialed to the public offering, then the international placing and the public offering will become 50% each.

    "title": "Green shoes: the Operation of \"protecting disk\" for Market stabilizing Merchants",
    "content": "Green shoes also known as the green shoe mechanism or green shoe options, is a special provision in the initial public offering () statement, which allows underwriters to sell more shares to investors than the issuer originally planned, which is legally called an \"overallotment right.\" This release is usually used when companies need more security than expected.In the IPO statement, the green shoe mechanism allows underwriters to short shares in the issuance of registered securities at the issue price. The scope of operation of the green shoe mechanism is different, but it usually does not exceed 15% of the original circulation.The green shoe mechanism ensures the stability and liquidity of the public offering. For example, a company chose an bank (or consortium, or syndicate) as underwriter and publicly issued 1 million shares through the latter, the price of which was determined by agreement between the company and the buyer. When stocks begin to trade on the open market, the lead underwriter is responsible for assisting in ensuring that shares are traded at or above the issue price.When the trading price of a public offering is lower than the issue price, the issue is called a \"break\". This makes the stock will be considered by the customer to be unstable and unsatisfactory, which may further lead to the sell-off of shares and vacillate the purchase of stocks.To manage this situation, the underwriter can initially short sell to the customer in an excess of 15 per cent (in this case, 1.15 million shares). When the transaction price is determined and the 1.15 million shares are \"valid\" (that is, the public trading conditions are met), the underwriter can support and stabilize the issue price of the shares at the issue price or lower by buying back 15 per cent of the excess (in this case, 150000 shares).In doing so, underwriters do not have to take the risk of \"long\" the additional 15 per cent of the shares in their accounts, as the shares simply \"cover\" their short positions.When the issue succeeds, the demand for shares leads to an increase in the price of the stock and remains above the price of the issue. If underwriters close their positions by buying shares on the open market, they will buy stocks at a higher price than they did when they shorted them, thus suffering losses. The green shoe mechanism can play a role in this case, in which the company gives underwriters the right to overbuy at the beginning, allowing them to overbuy up to 15 per cent of the shares at the original issue price. By exercising the green shoe option, the underwriter can close the position by buying the stock at the price of short selling, thus avoiding the loss.If underwriters are able to buy back all oversold shares at or below the issue price (in support of the share price), they will not be required to exercise any green shoe options. If they can buy back some of the shares at or below the issue price (as the stock price eventually rises and exceeds the issue price), the underwriter will exercise part of the green shoe option to make up for the remaining short position.If underwriters are unable to buy back any oversold parts at or below the issue price because the stock immediately rises and stops, they will fully assume the 15 per cent short position and exercise 100 per cent of the green shoe option.",

    "content": "1. Futures paper trading involves four markets: the Hong Kong, the US, Japan futures, and Singapore markets. By tapping \"Claim Now\"， you can open a virtual account for each market and will have an initial assets of 10 million HKD, 10 million USD, 10 million JPY, and 10 million USD in each account, respectively.2. Trading rules: Only limit orders are supported; positions can be closed or reserved at the market price only.3. Forced liquidation rules: When your account equity falls below the maintenance margin, forced liquidation will be triggered. The system will first close out your positions near expiry dates, and then positions with floating losses in descending order.4. Delivery rules: Paper trading does not support physical delivery. You need to close out your positions before they expire. If your positions remain open after the last trading day, the system will automatically close them out.5. Paper trading adopts the rules of order matching. The highest bid (best bid) and the lowest ask (best ask) are the best prices for matching. A buy order at a price higher than the best ask or a sell order at a price lower than the best bid satisfies the matching conditions and will be automatically queued for execution.6. The paper trading system is not necessarily consistent with the real market. In case of any inconsistency, data in the paper trading system shall prevail.7. If you hold stock futures contracts of a listed company which is delisted for any reason, you may no longer trade such contracts in later trading days, and the system will close out your positions at the last closing price.8. Transaction fees deducted in the paper trading system are not real expensed. The paper trading system is free of charge, so please feel free to use it.",

    "title": "How to build a strategy as a newbie",
    "content": "If you have a good idea, you may wonder how to realize it and quickly build a strategy on the canvas. 1. How to build a simple strategy to open and close positions only First of all, we must identify the conditions under which we want the strategy to open and close positions. Let's take the Double Moving Average (Double MA) strategy as an example. The Double MA strategy is to buy when the shorter-term moving average (MA) is above the longer-term MA, and sell when the shorter-term MA crosses below the longer-term MA. With this idea in mind, let's quickly figure out the paths to open and close positions. The upper path is to determine when to open positions, while the lower path, to close positions. When MA(5) is above MA(10), open a position; when MA(5) is below MA(10), close positions. But this strategy is not yet perfect. There is a serious problem: MA(5) may be continuously above MA(10) (golden cross) when the stock price is rising. If a position is opened every time it is determined that this condition is met, it won’t be long before your cash is used up (and margin may even be used), which is not what we expected. If MA(5) is above MA(10) all the time, we would like to buy once only. Similarly, if MA(5) is always below MA(10) (dead cross), we also wish to close positions only once. How can we achieve this? All we need is to add a condition to determine whether there is any position: The strategy determines whether to open a position only when there is no position, and whether to close a position only when there is a position. In this way, when the condition to open a position is met and the position is opened, we will hold the underlying stock in our position, and then the orange path will run and there will be no repeated opening of positions. In order to make the whole strategy more robust, we add a condition on buying power before opening a position to ensure that the order will not fail due to insufficient buying power. With this idea in mind, you may find our Double MA strategy not so hard to understand. Any images provided are not current and any securities shown are for illustrative purposes only and are not recommendations. By summarizing the above idea into a methodology, we get a general template for simple strategies to open and close positions. To create similar strategies later, you only need to apply the template and fill in the corresponding conditions to open and close positions. 2. How to set an adding-to-positions condition It is very simple to build a strategy to add to positions. Just add the green part to the original strategy. When the condition to close positions is not met, the strategy will determine whether the condition to add to positions is met. If this condition is met, an order can be placed to add to positions. Of course, don’t forget to make this condition to iterate at the end in case it is continuously met and the strategy will soon use up our cash. At the end of your strategy, consider updating the add-positions condition with a Value Assignment card. Otherwise, if the condition is consistently met, the strategy could add positions continuously, potentially leading to a quickly filled position. 3. How to set take-profit and stop-loss conditions It is also very simple to build a strategy to take profit and stop loss. Just replace the condition to close positions with the condition to take profit and close position as shown in the orange part, and then add a similar path as shown in the purple part. When the condition to take profit and close position is not met, the strategy will determine whether the condition to stop loss is met. If this condition is met, close position. 4. How to set an adding-to-positions condition and take-profit and stop-loss conditions By integrating the purple part (stop-loss condition) and the green part (adding-to-positions condition) above, we get a template for a strategy that can not only add to positions, but also take profit and stop loss. When there is a position, the strategy first determines whether the condition to take profit and close positions is met; if so, it will take profit (close all positions). If that condition is not met, the strategy determines whether the condition to stop loss and close positions is met; if so, it will stop loss (close all positions). If that condition is not met, the strategy determines whether the condition to add to positions is met; if so, it will place an order to add to the positions and make the adding-to-positions condition to iterate. Losses can happen more quickly with quant and algorithmic trading compared to other forms of trading. Trading in financial markets carries inherent risks, making effective risk management a crucial aspect of quantitative trading systems. These risks encompass various factors that can disrupt the performance of such systems, including market volatility leading to losses. Moreover, quants face additional risks such as capital allocation, technology, and broker-related uncertainties. It's important to note that automated investment strategies do not guarantee profits or protect against losses. The responsiveness of the trading system or app may vary due to market conditions, system performance, and other factors. Account access, real-time data, and trade execution may be affected by factors such as market volatility.

    "title": "Option Paper Trading Rules",
    "content": "1. Option paper trading involves two markets: the Hong Kong stock market and the market. By tapping the 「Create」 button, you can open a virtual account for each market and will have an initial asset of 1 million HKD and 1 million USD in each account, respectively. 2. The product types you can trade in paper trading for the Hong Kong and the US stock markets are limited to stock option products listed on the exchanges. 3. Hong Kong stock market trading hours: 9:30 AM-12:00 PM, 1:00 PM-4:00 PM (China Standard Time); US stock market trading hours: 9:30 AM-4:00 PM (Eastern Time). 4. Hong Kong stock option exercise rules: Exercise is not supported. On the expiration date, if the intrinsic value of an option is less than 1.5% of its exercise price, the option’s value will be 0; otherwise the option will be settled in cash. 5. US stock option exercise rules: Exercise is not supported. On the expiration date, if the intrinsic value of an option is less than 0.01 USD, the option’s value will be 0; otherwise the option will be settled in cash. 6. Option trading rules: Only limit orders are supported; positions in in-the-money options must be closed out before the expiration date. 7. Option settlement rules: The paper trading system has simplified the settlement rules. Proceeds from selling option contracts settle the same day (T+0). 8. The paper trading system is not necessarily consistent with the real stock market. In case of any inconsistency, data in the paper trading system shall prevail. 9. If you hold stock options of a listed company which is delisted for any reason, no longer trade, you may no longer trade such options in later trading days, and the system will return the virtual funds to your virtual account at the last closing price. 10. Hong Kong stock option transaction fee: Commission: 0.2% * transaction amount, minimum 3 HKD per order; Platform fee: 15 HKD per order; Trading tariff: 3 HKD per contract per side. 11. US stock option transaction fee: Commission: 0.65 USD per contract, minimum 1.99 USD per order; Platform fee: 0.3 USD per contract; SEC regulatory fee: 0.0000229 * transaction amount, minimum 0.01 USD per order (sells only); Trading activity fee: $0.00279 per contract, minimum $0.01/trade (sells only); Options regulatory fee: 0.02915 USD per contract. 12. Paper trading adopts the rules of order matching. The highest bid (best bid) and the lowest ask (best ask) are the best prices for matching. A buy order at a price higher than the best ask or a sell order at a price lower than the best bid satisfies the matching conditions and will be automatically queued for execution. 13. Transaction fees deducted in paper trading system are not real expenses. The paper trading system is free of charge, so please feel free to use it.",

Trading in financial markets carries inherent risks, making effective risk management a crucial aspect of quantitative trading systems. These risks encompass various factors that can disrupt the performance of such systems, including market volatility leading to losses. Moreover, quants face additional risks such as capital allocation, technology, and broker-related uncertainties. It's important to note that automated investment strategies do not guarantee profits or protect against losses. The responsiveness of the trading system or app may vary due to market conditions, system performance, and other factors.

Before conducting live trading, it is recommended that you perform multiple backtestings on the strategy to see if it has been configured properly and if it will be executed as you expect. In addition, Futu supports trading of a variety of products in multiple markets, including the Hong Kong stock, , A-share, and futures markets. However, the specific types of products you can trade vary slightly with each market. For example, the A-share market does not support market orders, while stop loss market orders and market if touched orders are not available in the futures market. You will discover it via backtest. 3. Use \"Running Log\" 3.1 Running log Running logs are available for both backtesting and live trading. Running logs contain details of Operations Cards execution, order status and transaction status after an order is placed, reports of various exceptions, etc. Each log consists of 3 parts: ● Time: Beijing time ● Properties: 3 categories ○ Info: information and records during normal running. E.g.: operations execution results, order status changes, transaction status changes, quotes access changes, etc. ○ Warning: exception alerts that will not interrupt the running of the entire strategy. E.g.: order failed, order invalid, etc. ○ Error: exception reports that will interrupt the running of the strategy. E.g.: global variable assignment exception leading to strategy initialization failure, quotes subscription exception leading to strategy initialization failure, insufficient validity period after trade is unlocked, etc. ● Details: ○ Title: If the log content is related to a Condition card or Operation, the format of the title will be \"Condition/Operation Name-Condition/Operation Type\" so as to indicate the corresponding Condition Card or Operation Card on the canvas ○ Body: details 3.2 How to use running logs 1）Check the running logs of a strategy for errors or warnings. If there are any errors or warnings, adjust the strategy according to the instructions in the logs to prevent these errors from happening again. 2）If you want to check whether a Condition judged correctly, you can use \"Value Assignment Card\" to print the values of its variables (see 3.2.1 for details). Or you can use \"Alert Settings Card\" to print customized information (see 3.2.2 for details). 3.2.1 How to use \"Value Assignment Card\" You can now print logs of execution results of Operations, but you may wonder how to identify problems of Conditions. In fact, we only need to print the values of Conditions’ variables. E.g.: When comparing the sizes of two MAs, we usually configure a Condition as below. However, when MA(5) was found to be less than MA(10) in the backtest, the system did not continue to run the strategy. In this case, we can create two new global variables, and assign MA(5) and MA(10) to the two global variables by using \"Value Assignment Card\", so that we can view the exact values of MA(5) and MA(10) in the logs during the running of the strategy. 3.2.2 How to use \"Alert Settings Card\" You can print customized alerts in the logs by adding \"Alert Settings Card\" as needed. E.g.: For a double moving average strategy, you may want to know which condition was not met, thus leading to the failed execution of the order. In this case, we can put a \"Alert Settings Card\" after each Condition Card and get the answer from the logs. 4.

How is a trade classified? ↑: Lift the Offer, meaning the trade is executed at the offer (or ask) price; shown in \"Up Color.\" ↓: Hit the Bid, meaning the trade is executed at the bid price; shown in \"Down Color.\" ◆: Neutral Trade, meaning the trade is executed between the bid and ask prices; shown in gray. * Users can customize \"Up/Down Colors\" in Settings. Two types are now available: (1) Red Up/Green Down & (2) Green Down/Red Up. 2. How do neutral trades happen? 1) The trade is executed so fast that it is not disclosed on the order book. For example, the current bid is $10 and the ask is $12. If two trading counterparties both place an order at $11 at the same time, we will see an $11 trade updated in \"Ticks\" while the BBO doesn't change. The trade will be defined as \"neutral\". 2) The trade is executed in a dark pool or other ATS (US Market) 3) Odd-lot trade (US Market) In the US, there are over 10 exchanges and many OTC dealers. The National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) presents quote data that shows the highest bid price and the lowest ask price from all available exchanges and trading venues. The NBBO, therefore, represents the smallest spread available. The direction of a trade is determined based on the NBBO Time & Sales (Ticks) data. Regulation NMS issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires brokers to ensure the best execution price available for a stock, and provide the NBBO quote data to their customers during trading. NBBO quote data only displays orders whose size is larger than 100 shares.",

    "content": "1. Definition Also known as the market position overview of float (shares that are available for trading by the public), the Function presents the number of shares held at different prices by investors. 2. Usage Guide 2.1 Reading the Graph a) Colors (As per the 「Quote Color」 setting in the App. Here \"Green Up / Red Down\" is used as an example) Green: profitable positions; position cost < current stock price Red: loss-making positions; position cost > current stock price Gray: neutral positions; position cost = current stock price Blue: current stock price b) Terminology Profit Ratio: the proportion of profitable positions Average Cost: the average price of all positions Resistance: the average price of loss-making positions Support: the average price of profitable positions 90% Position Cost Range: the price range of 90% of all positions 70% Position Cost Range: the price range of 70% of all positions Degree of Overlap: the extent to which the two Ranges overlap. The greater the Degree of Overlap, the more concentrated the positions and the more moderate the stock price fluctuation. 2.2 Interpreting Patterns a) Low-Level Concentration: As the stock price falls, position costs gradually decrease. When most of the positions are concentrated to the low price level, the resistance weakens and a rise in stock price is possible. b) High-Level Concentration: As the stock price rises, position costs gradually increase. When most of the positions are concentrated to the high price level, it may indicate that the low-cost positions have already exited after taking profit and that a momentum to fall is gathering strength. c) Double-Peak Pattern: This pattern mostly occurs in stocks with repeated price fluctuations within a certain range. The upper peak can be regarded as the resistance and the lower support. Investors may be better off if they 「sell high and buy low」 in accordance with the rhythm of price fluctuations. 3.

    "content": "1. What is algorithmic trading?To put it simply, algorithmic trading is a process of realizing one’s philosophies and strategies by means of computer technologies and certain mathematic models.Instead of relying on one’s personal feelings to manage assets, algorithmic trading is to convert proper investment thoughts and experience into quantitative models and to process information through computers in order to achieve automatic or semi-automatic trading. 2. How to use Futubull Algo feature？2.1 IntroductionOpen Futubull in Windows and click the \"Algo\" tab on the left.The interface is designed to be easy. You don’t need to program by yourself in the whole process. All it takes is a few simple steps of clicking and dragging to set up an algorithmic trading strategy and carry out backtest and live trading.2.2 Onboarding task strategyThe onboarding task will be initiated once you click the \"Algo\" tab for the first time.All you need is a Condition and an Operation to establish a simple strategy. The strategy includes 2 important elements: what condition to meet and what operation to execute.For example, in the onboarding task, the strategy will determine whether a golden cross occurs in the MACD of Trigger Symbol 1.If yes, a market order of 5,000 board lots will be placed; if no, no operation will be executed.",

    "content": "1. What is Device Lock The Device Lock feature can help protect your account from unauthorized access. When enabled, you will need to verify your login password and an SMS verification code when logging in for the first time on a new device using your User ID, email, or phone number. It is only required when you access your account for the first time from a new device. Once you have verified the new device, you can log in on this device by either entering your login password or an SMS verification code. 1.1 How to enable Device Lock To enable Device Lock in the Futubull app: Path: Me > Settings > Account and Security > Manage Devices > Device Lock To keep your account safe, you need to verify your phone number or set a login password before you can enable the Device Lock. Once the Device Lock is enabled, it can't be disabled. 2. Frequent & Verified Devices You can manage your devices by going to the following page in the Futubull app: Path: Me > Settings > Account and Security > Manage Devices 2.1 What are Verified Devices Verified Devices are ones you have verified as secure and can be used to easily log in to your account. When the Device Lock is on, you can view your verified devices on the Manage Devices page. You can change the name of your devices, view the device model, last login time on that device, and the login history. You can also remove a verified device. Once deleted, your account will be automatically logged out on that device. If you want to log in again on that device, you will need to verify your login password and an SMS verification code. 2.2 What are Frequent Devices Your most frequently used three devices will automatically be set as Frequent Devices and displayed at the top of the Manage Devices page. Other verified devices will be displayed as Other Devices. If you don't use a frequent device to log in for over a month, it will be changed to a verified device. If you don't use a verified device to log in for more than 6 months, you'll need to confirm your login password and SMS verification code the next time you log in. You can also manually set your verified devices as Frequent Devices or move a frequently used device from Frequent Devices to Other Devices.",

    "title": "Catch exceptions to improve your strategies",
    "content": "How to catch error code exceptions When exceptions occur during the calling of algo functions, an APIException is thrown. This exception contains an err_code attribute that provides specific error code information corresponding to different error scenarios. Error Code Scenario ExceedReqLimit Requests too frequent ReqTimeout Request to the interface timed out NoQuoteRight No permission to access quotes InvalidArgument Invalid parameter (parameter validation failed) ReqFailed Interface request failed NoDataAvailable No data (returned data is NA) EmptySymbol The parameter symbol is empty Unknow Unknown error To strengthen your strategy, you can catch error codes at critical points in the strategy and execute custom handling procedures. Example: To improve the reliability of order placements, consider using a custom-coded card that attempts to resubmit the order until it succeeds in the event of an initial failure. while True: try: place_limit(symbol=self.trigger_symbol 1, price=2, qty=100, side=OrderSide.BUY, time_in_force=TimeInForce.DAY) break # Order placed successfully. Exit the loop. except APIException as ex: print('Order placement failed. Retry in 2 seconds.') time.sleep(2) continue # Order placement failed. Retry. Any images provided are not current and any securities or inputs shown are for illustrative purposes only and are not recommendations. How to use a Custom-Coded Card vs Global Exception Settings Using a custom-coded card for exception handling overrides the global exception settings. Example 1: Passive exception catching Use a standard card without custom coding to catch exception error codes. Make sure to change the default settings: Set Exception Settings to Skip the Current Round Any images provided are not current and any securities or inputs shown are for illustrative purposes only and are not recommendations. When the strategy runs and reaches the No Retry on Order Failure card, it will follow the exception settings and skip this round if the order placement fails. Therefore, the Mark as Complete card will not be executed. The No Retry on Order Failure card will run again when the next signal triggers the strategy. Example 2: Active exception catching Use a custom-coded card to actively catch exception error codes and retry submitting the order until it is successful. Make sure to change the default settings: Set Exception Settings to Skip the Current Round Any images provided are not current and any securities or inputs shown are for illustrative purposes only and are not recommendations. When the strategy runs and reaches the Retry Order Placement on Exception card, you assume the first attempt to place an order fails. According to the steps shown in the image, when an error code is detected, the system will keep trying to resubmit the order until it succeeds. Afterward, the Mark as Complete card will be run next. Custom-coded cards designed to catch error code exceptions will capture any exceptions first. Once an exception is caught by the card, the global exception settings will not be triggered.

Considering convenience, Futu has packaged API SDKs for different programming languages for third parties to use. For more details, please go to the the API Doc. Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all customers. It is important that investors read Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options before engaging in any options trading strategies. Options transactions are often complex and may involve the potential of losing the entire investment in a relatively short period of time. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk, including the potential for losses that may exceed the original investment amount. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request. Futures live trading is currently only available for trading accounts with Moomoo SG or FUTU HK and is not yet supported by accounts with Moomoo US or Moomoo AU. Futures trading involves high risks and is not suitable for all investors. The amount you could lose may be greater than your initial investment. Losses can happen more quickly with quant and algorithmic trading compared to other forms of trading. Trading in financial markets carries inherent risks, making effective risk management a crucial aspect of quantitative trading systems. These risks encompass various factors that can disrupt the performance of such systems, including market volatility leading to losses. Moreover, quants face additional risks such as capital allocation, technology, and broker-related uncertainties. It's important to note that automated investment strategies do not guarantee profits or protect against losses. The responsiveness of the trading system or app may vary due to market conditions, system performance, and other factors. Account access, real-time data, and trade execution may be affected by factors such as market volatility.

    "content": "1. Trigger Symbol & Logic of Strategy Cycles Every strategy has at least one trigger symbol. Click \"Start Card”, and you’ll see it in the property bar on the right.Note: The \"Trigger Symbol 1” here is just used as a reference. A real trigger symbol will be chosen in live trading or backtesting later.Click \"Backtest\" or \"Live Trading\", and then you can choose a real trigger symbol in the setting window as the \"Trigger Symbol 1” above.One important role of the trigger symbol is to drive the cyclical running of the strategy. Therefore, you also need to set the interval between two rounds of running.For example, set the strategy as \"Apple (AAPL.US) & Run once for every tick”. It means that the strategy runs once for every time Apple (AAPL.US) has one tick. When the strategy runs, an order of 5,000 board lots will be placed if a golden cross occurs in the MACD.After the end of each round of running, the strategy will wait until Apple (AAPL.US) has another tick that will trigger another round of running. 2. Multiple Trigger Symbols & Multiple Trigger Symbol GroupsWhen building a strategy, we can set multiple trigger symbols on the canvas.We can also add multiple trigger symbol groups in backtest or live trading.So, what on earth is the difference between multiple trigger symbols and multiple trigger symbol groups?2.1 Multiple Trigger SymbolsTaking the onboarding task strategy as an example, two trigger symbols are set in the \"Start Card\" on the canvas.In the Backtest Setting window, assign the two trigger symbols as Alibaba (09988.HK) and Tencent Holdings (00700.HK) respectively.It indicates that the ticker of both Alibaba (09988.HK) and Tencent Holdings (00700.HK) will trigger the running of the onboarding task strategy.Moreover, it doesn't matter if the strategy is triggered by Alibaba (09988.HK) or Tencent Holdings (00700.HK). No matter which ticker of these two trigger symbols triggered the strategy, the determination logic is to place an order for Tencent Holdings (00700.HK) with the MACD of Alibaba (09988.HK) as a condition.2.2 Multiple Trigger Symbol GroupsFrom the above example, we can see the respective roles of different trigger symbols in one trigger symbol group.If you add another trigger symbol group to the onboarding task strategy and assign the two trigger symbols as Apple (AAPL.US) and Google (GOOG.US) respectively, what will happen?By setting multiple trigger symbol groups, you made a copy of the onboarding task strategy.The tickers of Alibaba (09988.HK) and Tencent Holdings (00700.HK) will only trigger the original onboarding task strategy; the tickers of Apple (AAPL.US) and Google (GOOG.US) will only trigger the copy.The original onboarding task strategy and the copy run in a relatively independent way, but they use the money (cash) and assets (stocks) in the same account (real account or backtest account).Therefore, if one strategy has taken up the buying power of the account, the other one may face a situation where the buying power is not sufficient to place an order.",

    "content": "If a signal continuously meets the condition, the strategy may repeatedly execute the ”Place Order Card” .How to ensure the strategy buys or sells only once when the signal meets the condition? Here are the two simplest methods.Method 1: Determine positionsIf the strategy places a type of order that can be filled quickly (e.g., a market order), then you can indirectly determine whether a position has been opened or closed successfully through the underlying stocks you are holding.● If the number of underlying stocks you are holding is > 0, then the position has been opened successfully, and the path to close positions will run;● If the number of underlying stocks you are holding is 0, then the position has been closed successfully or has not been opened, and the path to open positions will run;Note: This method requires that the order must be filled quickly; otherwise repeated orders may still be placed.Method 2: Use a counterIf the strategy places a type of order that may not be filled quickly (e.g., a limit order), you can create a value global variable as a counter to indicate whether an order has been placed.Step 1: Go to “Start Card\" > Properties > Global Variables, and create a counter named \"a\" to indicate whether a buy/sell order has been placed.● If a buy order has been placed and has held position , it will be represented by 1;● If no order has been placed and no position is held, it will be represented by 0;According to the above rules, the value of the global variable \"a\" is 0 by default (indicating that no order has been placed and no position is held).Step 2: Determine the global variable \"a\" and the number of holdings first when the strategy starts to run:● If \"a\" = 0, and the number of holdings = 0, it means that no order has been placed and no position is held, and the path to open positions will run;● If \"a\" = 1, and the number of holdings > 0, it means that a buy order has been placed and there are positions held (the buy order has been filled), and the path to close positions will run;Step 3: Add an ”Value Assignment Card” after the ”Place Order Card” , and re-assign value to the global variable \"a\":● Path to close positions: re-assign 0 to the global variable \"a\" to indicate a sell order has been placed.● Path to open positions: re-assign 1 to the global variable \"a\" to indicate a buy order has been placed.",

    "title": "How to set price alerts with custom indicators",
    "content": "Learn how to create and receive price alert messages. Follow this practical example below of a custom indicator. 1. Create a custom indicator To create your own custom indicator in Futubull: Go to Watchlist > Manage Indicators Craft your indicator's formula using the M language, then click Test. Once it's confirmed to work correctly, apply it to the chart. (Images provided are for reference only and may not be up-to-date. Securities or strategies mentioned herein are for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as recommendations.) 2. Use the customized indicator in Algo trading Once you have made your custom indicator, you can apply it to your algo trading strategy. Go to Algo > Manage Strategies > Conditions > Signal > Technical Analysis > More card Drag the More card onto the canvas. Choose the custom VWAP indicator you've created as the variable for comparison. (Images provided are for reference only and may not be up-to-date. Securities or strategies mentioned herein are for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as recommendations.) 3. Set price alerts Now that your algo trading strategy has been updated with your custom indicator, you can set an automated price alert. 3.1 Set an alert without variables Find the Alert Message card and drag it onto the canvas. Select In-app notification in the Properties panel. (Images provided are for reference only and may not be up-to-date. Securities or strategies mentioned herein are for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as recommendations.) After setting up your algo strategy, click Run Strategy > Live Trading to run it. You will receive an alert when the VWAP indicator meets the pre-set condition (i.e. when the VWAP is lower than the last price). You can also receive the alert message on the mobile app. (Images provided are for reference only and may not be up-to-date. Securities or strategies mentioned herein are for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as recommendations.) 3.2 Set an alert with variables If you want to be notified when the 1-hour VWAP for the trigger symbol falls below a stock's last trading price, including both the VWAP and the last price in the alert message: Follow the steps below: Drag the Alert Message card onto the canvas. Click the Edit button at the bottom right corner of the canvas to convert the card into a custom-coded card. (Images provided are for reference only and may not be up-to-date. Securities or strategies mentioned herein are for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as recommendations.) Customize your alert message using the alert() function with the necessary variables. vwap_value = vwap(symbol=self.trigger_symbol1, bar_type=BarType.H1, select=1) last_trade_price = current_price(symbol=self.trigger_symbol1) alert(title=\"\", content=\"The VWAP is {}, which is below the last price {}\".format(vwap_value, last_trade_price)) (Images provided are for reference only and may not be up-to-date. Securities or strategies mentioned herein are for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as recommendations.) Your custom indicator alert is ready. You can start live trading. When your set conditions are met, you'll receive the customized alert message on your devices. (Images provided are for reference only and may not be up-to-date. Securities or strategies mentioned herein are for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as recommendations.) VWAP is the average price of a stock weighted by the total trading volume. VWAP is used to calculate the average price of a stock over a period of time. Losses can happen more quickly with quant and algorithmic trading compared to other forms of trading. Trading in financial markets carries inherent risks, making effective risk management a crucial aspect of quantitative trading systems. These risks encompass various factors that can disrupt the performance of such systems, including market volatility leading to losses. Moreover, quants face additional risks such as capital allocation, technology, and broker-related uncertainties. It's important to note that automated investment strategies do not guarantee profits or protect against losses. The responsiveness of the trading system or app may vary due to market conditions, system performance, and other factors. Account access, real-time data, and trade execution may be affected by factors such as market volatility.

Taking the Martingale strategy as an example, the strategy runs once for every 1m candle during the market open of the HSI Future Main (HSImain.HK). Then, in what order do the Conditions Cards & Operations Cards on the canvas run? The strategy begins from \"Start Card\" and leads to 3 paths. The 3 paths run in an order from top to bottom and then from left to right (In the illustrative diagram, the running order of the 3 paths on the canvas is as follows: Path 1 > Path 2 > Path 3). A path will not begin until the previous path runs to the end; that is to say, the paths run in series, instead of in parallel.",

    "title": "Condition Cards - Max Qty to Buy or Sell",
    "content": "This article details the different types of Condition Cards available, their definitions, and features. 1. Max Qty to Buy (Margin) This condition card refers to the highest number of shares or contracts of a specific security that can be purchased using margin. This card is only applicable to strategies for stocks, ETFs, warrants, CBBCs, and options. However, it does not apply to futures. The maximum quantity to buy may vary depending on the specific order type and price. Stocks are counted in shares, whereas options are counted in the number of contracts. Margin trading entails greater risk, including, but not limited to, risk of loss and incurrence of margin interest debt, and is not suitable for all investors. 2. Max Qty to Buy (Cash) This condition card refers to the number of shares or contracts of a specific security that can be purchased using cash. This card is only applicable to strategies for stocks, ETFs, warrants, and options. However, it does not apply to futures. The maximum quantity to buy may vary depending on the specific order type and price. Stocks are counted in shares, whereas options are counted in the number of contracts. 3. Max Qty to Sell This condition card refers to the number of shares or contracts from the long position of a specific security that can be sold. When the long position exceeds the short position, the maximum quantity to sell is greater than or equal to zero. An unfilled limit sell order may cause a portion of the long position to be frozen, and reduce the available quantity to sell. When the short position exceeds the long position, the maximum quantity to sell is zero. Stocks are counted in shares, whereas futures and options are counted in the number of contracts. Futures live trading is currently only available for trading accounts with Moomoo SG or FUTU HK and is not yet supported by accounts with Moomoo US or Moomoo AU. Futures trading involves high risks and is not suitable for all investors. The amount you could lose may be greater than your initial investment. 4. Max Qty to Buyback This condition card refers to the number of shares or contracts from a short position in a specified security that can be purchased to close the position. When holding a net long position, the maximum quantity to buy back equals zero. When holding a net short position, the maximum quantity to buy back is greater than zero. An unfilled limit buy order may cause a portion of the short position to be frozen, and reduce the available quantity to buy. Stocks are counted in shares, whereas futures and options are counted in the number of contracts. 5. Max Qty to Sell Short This condition card refers to the highest number of shares or contracts of a specified security that can be sold short. This card is only applicable to strategies for stocks, ETFs, warrants, and options. However, it does not apply to futures. The maximum quantity to sell short may vary depending on the specific order type and price. Stocks are counted in shares, whereas options are counted in the number of contracts. When short selling there is no limit on how high a stock price could rise so the potential loss is unlimited. Other risks include dividend risk and margin risk, this strategy is not appropriate for all investors. 6. Initial Margin per Contract This condition card refers to the initial margin applicable for each contract. The initial margin per contract may vary depending on the type of order and the price. The margin is denominated in the currency used to price the underlying security. For example, the initial margin per contract for S&P 500 (US.ESmain) is denominated in US dollars.

    "title": "Operations Card - Close all positions",
    "content": "1. \"Close All Positions Card\" is implemented through a combination of APIs. It is targeted at not only orders generated in using certain quantitative strategies, but all open positions and all unfilled orders in an account. 2. \"Close All Positions Card\" will trigger a request to cancel orders or liquidate positions, but there's no guarantee that the request will be carried out successfully. Here is how it works: • Liquidate all positions: All positions in the account are liquidated by placing opposite orders on a one-by-one basis. • Cancel all orders and liquidate all positions: First, all unfilled orders in the account are cancelled, and then all positions in the account are liquidated by placing opposite orders on a one-by-one basis. 3. Order types for liquidation Market Product Type Order Type for Liquidation HK Securities (including stocks, ETFs, warrants, CBBCs, Inline Warrants) Mkt Options Lmt Futures Mkt US Securities (including stocks, ETFs) Mkt Options Mkt Futures Mkt HKCC Securities (including stocks, ETFs) Lmt Singapore Futures Lmt Japan Futures Lmt Note: When using a limit order to close a position, the order price will be the 5th price level of opposite orders in the order book. If there are no opposite orders under the top 5 price levels each, that position will not be closed, and the system will continue to close other positions. Suppose you hold stocks of Tencent (HK.00700). When using \"Liquidate all positions Card\", the price of a sell limit order will be the 5th price level of buy orders in the order book. Futures live trading is currently only available for trading accounts with Moomoo SG or Futu HK and is not yet supported by accounts with Moomoo US or Moomoo AU. Futures trading involves high risks and is not suitable for all investors. The amount you could lose may be greater than your initial investment. Losses can happen more quickly with quant and algorithmic trading compared to other forms of trading. Trading in financial markets carries inherent risks, making effective risk management a crucial aspect of quantitative trading systems. These risks encompass various factors that can disrupt the performance of such systems, including market volatility leading to losses. Moreover, quants face additional risks such as capital allocation, technology, and broker-related uncertainties. It's important to note that automated investment strategies do not guarantee profits or protect against losses. The responsiveness of the trading system or app may vary due to market conditions, system performance, and other factors. Account access, real-time data, and trade execution may be affected by factors such as market volatility.
