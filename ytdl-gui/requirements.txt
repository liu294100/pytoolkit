# --- Notes ---
# 1. Tkinter (for the GUI) is part of the Python standard library on Windows/macOS.
#    On Linux, you might need to install it separately using your system's package manager
#    (e.g., 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-tk' on Debian/Ubuntu).
#    It is NOT installed via pip.

# 2. The version numbers (>=X.Y.Z) indicate minimum compatible versions based on common usage.
#    For strict reproducibility, you might want to freeze specific versions using:
#    pip freeze > requirements.txt
