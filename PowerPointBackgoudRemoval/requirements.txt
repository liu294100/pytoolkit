# Core library for reading and manipulating .pptx files
python-pptx>=0.6.18

# Library for image processing (used for background image validation and potentially by python-pptx)
Pillow>=9.0.0

# lxml is a dependency of python-pptx, explicitly listing it can sometimes help resolve environment issues,
# but usually pip handles it automatically when installing python-pptx. Optional.
# lxml>=4.9.0

# --- Notes ---
# 1. Tkinter (for the GUI) is part of the Python standard library on Windows/macOS.
#    On Linux, you might need to install it separately using your system's package manager
#    (e.g., 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-tk' on Debian/Ubuntu).
#    It is NOT installed via pip.
#
# 2. LibreOffice (or OpenOffice) with 'soffice' accessible in the system PATH is required
#    for converting .ppt files. This must be installed separately and is NOT managed by pip.
#
# 3. The version numbers (>=X.Y.Z) indicate minimum compatible versions based on common usage.
#    For strict reproducibility, you might want to freeze specific versions, e.g.:
#    python-pptx==0.6.21
#    Pillow==10.0.1
#    You can find your current versions using 'pip freeze'.
